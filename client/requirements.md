## Packages
framer-motion | For smooth page transitions and entry animations
canvas-confetti | For the celebration effect on successful authorization
@types/canvas-confetti | Types for confetti

## Notes
- The /callback page automatically triggers the Discord OAuth exchange on mount
- Animations for the success state (check draw, progress bar) use CSS keyframes defined in index.css
- Tailwind config needs to extend font family for 'Outfit' and 'DM Sans'
